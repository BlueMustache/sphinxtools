# sphinxtools
Unpackers and modding tools for the GameCube version of the «_Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy_» game.


## Background

The game files are all packed inside an uncompressed container file called `Filelist.000`. The game engine actually reads a small binary descriptor file called `Filelist.bin`,
which contains a table mapping various internal hash codes with their original internal filenames, lengths and (one or more) container numbers with their respective offset/position inside every container. Those packed files tend to appear sector-aligned, and they are often duplicated in two or more places inside of the same container file to improve disk seek times.

As far as I can, tell only the PlayStation 2 version of the game splits the game files in more than one container (`Filelist.000` and `Filelist.001`), also the _PlayStation 2_ and _XBOX_ fields are stored in reversed byte-order (little-endian), while GameCube uses big-endian.
This tool should comply with all the different variants.

I have sucessfully extracted the contents of the _GameCube_, _PlayStation 2_ and _XBOX_ versions.

## How to use

My extractor is written in simple C99 with some UNIX functions, which require Linux, Mac or BSD to compile, even if you could compile it as a Windows executable with some small changes.

Compile the C file like this with your favourite Linux compiler (GCC or Clang):

    gcc sphinx_filelistbin_extract.c -o sphinx_filelistbin_extract

Copy all the `Filelist.bin`, `Filelist.000`, ... files from your original game disk. That's all you need.

Place them in the same folder than the extractor. Run the extractor in your Terminal:

    ./sphinx_filelistbin_extract Filelist.bin


The unpacked files will appear in the current directory as subfolders named as the original Windows hard drive letters (either `x:`, or `d:`) used by Eurocom.


## Internal _EngineX_ file formats

Here is a rundown of the unpacked contents of the game. Sorted by extension.

* __`*.h` files__: Text-based C/C++ headers from the original source code. They are there to map hexadecimal hashcodes to human-readable tags (of EDB files, items, songs, sounds, levels and other assets) used by the programmers.
Probably autogenerated from some internal tool and included there to be read by the in-game editor/viewer.
* __`*.edb` files__: General-purpose workhorse proprietary binary container format. Extension probably derived from _Engine/Eurocom database_. Non-exhaustive list of things you can find inside:
 - BSP maps
 - 3D geometry
 - S3TC compressed textures
 - Texture regions
 - Localized text strings
 - Animations
 - Scripts
 - Script events
 - HUD and GUI
 - AI navigation paths
 - Animation skins
 - Animation datums
 - Animation modes
 - Animation sets
 - Particle effects
 - Swooshs
 - Items
    - Ability Items
    - Quest Items
    - Weapon Items
    - Item Objects
 - Triggers
 - Objectives

* __`*.sfx` files__: Binary _Sound effect_ container. Used also by music tracks.
